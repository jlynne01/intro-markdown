This is another example way to have a __strong text__ in our document. Anything between the two double opening underscore and two double closing underscore will be displayed as __strong text__

<!--Strike Through-->
This is an example of a ~~strike through~~ text, anything in between the double tilde opening characters and closing double tilde characters will be displayed as ~~strike through~~ text

<!--Horizontal Rule-->

We can add triple hyphens to be able to create a horizontal rule for separating content.

Another way to add __HORIZONTAL RULES__ in our document is by using three underscores.
