<!--Strong-->
This is an example of **strong text**, anything between the two opening asterisk and two closing asterisk will be displayed as strong text

This is another example way to have a __strong text__ in our document. Anything between the two double opening underscore and two double closing underscore will be displayed as __strong text__

<!--Strike Through-->
This is an example of a ~~strike through~~ text, anything in between the double tilde opening characters and closing double tilde characters will be displayed as ~~strike through~~ text

<!--Horizontal Rule-->

We can add triple hyphens to be able to create a horizontal rule for separating content.

Another way to add __HORIZONTAL RULES__ in our document is by using three underscores.

___

<!--ESCAPE Character Rule using Backslash-->

This is an example of a *text with an asterisk*. When we don't want it to be italicized. We want to use the backslash to escape the rule of using an opening \*asterisk* and closing \*astersik* to enclose the text contents.

___

<!--Blockquote Rule-->

> We use the greater than symbol to display a block of text as a quote with a background and line on the left side.

> *"You don't have to be great to start, but you need to start to be great."* -Unknown Author
